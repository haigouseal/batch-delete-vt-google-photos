# batch-delete-vt-google-photos
Batch select and delete Google Photos 

 * Batch select and delete Google Photos in the current window view. 
 * Scrolls the page and selects photos for deletion.

Create this script because Virginia Tech sent me email requesting complete removal of Google Photo content.
